/*
You'll be given a list of two strings, and each will contain exactly one colon (":") 
in the middle (but not at beginning or end). The length of the strings, before and after the colon, are random.
Your job is to return a list of two strings (in the same order as the original list), 
but with the characters after each colon swapped.

  let res = [];
  res.push(first[0]+":"+second[1]);
  res.push(second[0]+":"+first[1]);
